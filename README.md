# Global_CO-_Emission_analysis

# Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker by Sector
This project provides a data-driven analysis and interactive dashboard to visualize global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across sectors and countries. The goal is to understand emission trends and support climate-related decision-making with transparent and contextual data.

# Files Included
 1.co2emission_bysecctors.csv – Raw emissions dataset by country, sector, and date.
 2.world_gdp_population.csv – Global GDP and population data by year.
 3.load_ds.py – Python script for data cleaning, transformation, and metric computation.
 4.cleaned_emissions_data.csv – Final cleaned dataset used for visualization.
 5.Co2 emission analysis.pbix – Power BI dashboard file.
 6.Global_CO2_Emission_Analysis_report.pdf – 2-page summary report of methodology and findings.

# Tools Used
 1.Python (Pandas) – Data preprocessing and metric calculations.
 2.Power BI – Dashboard design and interactive visualizations.
 3.Excel – Initial validation and manual data adjustments.

# Outcome
An interactive dashboard to monitor global CO₂ emissions with insights into sectoral contributions, economic context, and top emitters. Useful for policymakers, researchers, and the public.
